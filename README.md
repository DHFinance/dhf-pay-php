# dhf-pay-php
PHP SDK to integrate with DHFinance in minutes.
# Getting Started
1. **Sign up for DHFinance** - Before you begin, you need to sign up for an DHFinance account and retrieve your store API token.
2. **Requirements** â€“ To run the SDK, your system will need to have PHP >= 7.2, cURL and Composer installed . We highly recommend having it compiled with the cURL extension and cURL 7.16.2+ compiled with a TLS backend (e.g., NSS or OpenSSL).
3. **Install** sdk using composer

```sh
 "require": {
        dhfinance/dhf-pay-php": "*"

    }
```
# Create payment
 ```sh
 $dhfPay = new DHFPay('<API endpoint>', '<Token>');
        $params = [
            "amount"=> 2500000000,
            "comment"=> "test comment"
        ];
        $payment = $dhfPay
            ->payments()
            ->add($params);
```
 
# Payments List
```sh
$dhfPay->payments()->getAll();
```


# Get payments by id
```sh
$dhfPay->payments()->getOne();
```
# Get transactions list
